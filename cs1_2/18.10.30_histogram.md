## Random Dictionary Words Code Review:

Cheating
- .shuffle
- .counter
- .choice

### Nathan:
```python

import random
word_num = sys.argv[1]

def dict_sentence(word_num):
    with open("/usr/share/dict/words") as file:
        dict_word = file.read().splitlines()

    random_num_array = list() # line number Nathan wants to read

    for _ in range(int(word_num)):
        random_num_array.append(randint(0, len(dict_word)-1))

    for rand in random_num_array:
        print(''.join(dict_word[rand]), end=' ')

dict_sentence(word_num)
print("hello")
```

#### Nathan:
by default with open files open in read mode

#### Dylan:
used timeInt
- look into timeInt
You probably don't need two for loops to do this

#### Tim:
Could use Doc String explaining what it does at beginning of code

#### Vincenzo:
Scoping Rules
- look up scoping rules

#### ? :
No return value

### Jasmine:

```python
import random_num_arrayfrom sys import argv

def get_word(wordlist):
    '''
    returns a random word from wordlist
    '''
    return random.choice(wordlist)

def get_words(num, wordlist):
    '''
    returns num number of words from the wordlist
    '''
    words= list()
    for _ in range(num):
        word = get_word(wordlist)
        words.append(word)
    return words

if __name__ == "__main__":
    with open("/usr/shar/dict/words") as words:
        words = words.read().splitlines()

    my_words = get_words(int( argv[1]), words)
    print(" ".join(my_words))

```

#### Asim:
Appreciated Modularity

#### Nolan:
if name is helpful
- look more into if name

#### Alan:
- would like argv[1] to have a name
- make function for bottom four lines to keep logic outside of "if __name__"
